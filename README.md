# SecureMe

**SecureMe** is a tool designed to assess the strength of your passwords. Input your password and let the software run various algorithms to evaluate how secure it is and estimate how fast it can be breached. This is useful for anyone looking to improve their password security and avoid easily cracked passwords.

## Features:
- Evaluates password strength based on multiple cracking algorithms.
- Provides an estimated time to breach for a given password.
- Recommends a new secure password if your current one is not secure.
- Generates random secure passwords.
